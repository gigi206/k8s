# =============================================================================
# ArgoCD CI-specific Helm Values
# =============================================================================
# Resource exclusions and health overrides for CI environment (K3d).
# Baked into the Helm install to avoid timing issues with post-install patches.
#
# Resource exclusions reduce ArgoCD's cluster-wide resource tracking overhead,
# improving reconciliation speed for all Applications.
#
# Health overrides force Healthy status for operator-managed CRs whose health
# depends on operator reconciliation timing (cert-manager certificate chains,
# Prometheus/Alertmanager status conditions).

    # Resource Exclusions
    # =========================================================================
    # Reduce ArgoCD's cluster-wide resource tracking. These CRD-based resources
    # depend on operators being fully ready and can slow down reconciliation.
