# =============================================================================
# HTTPRoute + OAuth2 SnippetsFilter for nginx-gateway-fabric (Hubble UI)
# =============================================================================
# Combines HTTPRoutes with OAuth2 authentication for nginx-gwf.
# Uses httproute/ as base and adds SnippetsFilter + extensionRef patches.
# SECURITY: All resources are in the same source, ensuring atomic deployment.
# If SnippetsFilter CRD doesn't exist, entire source fails = no unprotected routes.
