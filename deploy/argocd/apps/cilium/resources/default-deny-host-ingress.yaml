# =============================================================================
# CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy - Default Deny Host Ingress
# =============================================================================
# This policy blocks ALL external ingress to Kubernetes nodes by default.
# Only essential services are allowed:
# - SSH (22) - for node administration
# - Kubernetes API (6443) - for kubectl access
# - Internal cluster traffic - always allowed
#
# Applications needing additional host ports (e.g., 80/443 for ingress) must
# define their own CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy. Example:
# - istio-gateway: deploy/argocd/apps/istio-gateway/resources/cilium-host-ingress-policy.yaml
