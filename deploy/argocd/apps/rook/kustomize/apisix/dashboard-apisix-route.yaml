# =============================================================================
# ApisixRoute - Ceph Dashboard
# =============================================================================
# Routes traffic to Ceph Dashboard (HTTPS backend on port 8443)
# Note: Ceph Dashboard uses SAML2 SSO directly with Keycloak for authentication
#
# HTTPS Backend: Uses custom Service (ceph-dashboard-https) with appProtocol: https.
# APISIX Ingress Controller automatically detects HTTPS backend from appProtocol field.
# This is needed because Rook operator doesn't set appProtocol on its Service.
