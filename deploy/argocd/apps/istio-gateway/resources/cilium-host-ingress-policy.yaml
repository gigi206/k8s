# =============================================================================
# CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy - Istio Gateway Host Ingress
# =============================================================================
# Allow external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to nodes for Istio Gateway LoadBalancer.
# This complements the default-deny-host-ingress policy in cilium app.
#
# Node Targeting:
# - With externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster (default), all nodes need ports open
# - With externalTrafficPolicy: Local, only nodes running Gateway pods need ports
#
# To restrict to specific nodes, use nodeSelector with labels like:
#   matchLabels:
#     node-role.kubernetes.io/ingress: ""
#
# Only enable this when using Istio as ingress controller.
# Other ingress controllers (Traefik, nginx, etc.) should define similar
# policies in their respective app directories.
