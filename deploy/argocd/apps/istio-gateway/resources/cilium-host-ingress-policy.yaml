# CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy - Istio Gateway Host Ingress
# =============================================================================
# Allow external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to nodes for Istio Gateway LoadBalancer.
# This complements the default-deny-host-ingress policy in cilium app.
#
# Only enable this when using Istio as ingress controller.
# Other ingress controllers (Traefik, nginx, etc.) should define similar
# policies in their respective app directories.
